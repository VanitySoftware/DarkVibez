# About Discord Web-App
DarkVibez also works fine with the Discord Web-App if you use an Extension which supports Custom-CSS for specific websites.

# About macOS
Using DarkVibez with macOS causes 1 little issue, which is not that noticable.

# About Light mode
DarkVibez is not meant to be used with Light mode! Doing so WILL cause visual problems.

# About Discord Nitro themes
DarkVibez blocks the selection of these Nitro themes. If you have one enabled, disable it.
